<p>Dear ${profile.givenName}</p>
<p>Thank you for registering with the Heart Hive!</p>
<p>You are invited to take part in the HeartHive Cardiomyopathy Study, set up by researchers at Imperial College London.</p>
<p>${dashboardLink} and you'll find the interactive consent form which will go over all the details involved in the study, and don't forget to complete the baseline health survey. <br /><br /></p>
<p>Our vision is that all patients with cardiovascular disease should have the opportunity to participate in research into their condition, to advance knowledge and treatment.  The more people take part in research, the more powerful it is.<br /><br /></p>
<p>The main aim of this research study is to better understand how genetic and environmental factors interact to contribute to developing cardiomyopathy and influence severity and disease course. <br /><br /></p>
<p>You can find full details of the study in the eConsent, also available in the Heart Hive portal. If you wish to withdraw from the study, you can do so at any time.<br /><br /></p>
<p>Please contact us at ${participantSupportEmailLink} if you have any questions or concerns.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
