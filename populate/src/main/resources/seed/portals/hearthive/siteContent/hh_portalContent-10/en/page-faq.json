          "question" : "How do I register for the Heart Hive?",
          "answer" : "You are eligible if you meet any one of these criteria:\n\n* You have a diagnosis of cardiomyopathy or myocarditis\n\n* You have a family history of cardiomyopathy\n\n* You have had genetic testing revealing that you have an inherited risk for cardiomyopathy\n\nOr you can register if you **do not** have heart disease and would like to be in our comparison group (check out the Participants Without Heart Disease FAQ section for more details).\n\nHead to our [registration page](hearthive/studies/cmyop/join) where you can set up an account and provide some basic information about yourself."
        }, {
          "question" : "Why is this needed?",
          "answer" : "Individuals of South Asian ancestry are disproportionately affected by cardiometabolic diseases, including heart disease, stroke, and diabetes. However, they have historically been underrepresented in genetic studies. In the United States, South Asian ancestry is now considered a risk-enhancing factor for cardiovascular disease, highlighting an awareness but distinct knowledge gap. OurHealth aims to address this gap by creating a cohort of South Asian individuals, from whom survey and genomic data will be analyzed to further our understanding of cardiovascular disease risk within this population."
        }, {
          "question" : "How can I participate?",
          "answer" : "If you are over 18 years of age, live in the United States, and identify as South Asian, you can sign up by clicking [“Join”](/studies/ourheart/join)."
        }, {
          "question" : "What does participation entail?",
          "answer" : "OurHealth participants are able to share different kinds of information by completing surveys within the OurHealth participant portal. Some participants will receive a saliva sample collection kit. We will study your sample (i.e., DNA) to help improve our understanding of cardiovascular disease among South Asians. OurHealth will stay in touch with participants over time about new opportunities to share data through additional surveys, new research studies, and new electronic tools, including apps."
        }, {
          "question" : "What does OurHealth do with the data?",
          "answer" : "Only data and/or specimens necessary for study conduct will be collected. The electronic data collected will be maintained in a secure location with appropriate protections including password protection, encryption, and/or physical security measures (locked files/areas). The specimens collected will be maintained in a secure location with appropriate protections (e.g. locked storage spaces, laboratory areas). Data and specimens will only be shared with individuals who are members of the IRB-approved research team or approved for sharing as described in the IRB protocol. Identifiers will be coded and access to files linking identifiers with coded data or specimens will be limited to the minimal necessary members of the research team. All staff are trained on and will follow the Mass General Brigham policies and procedures for maintaining appropriate confidentiality of research data and specimens. All electronic communication with participants will comply with Mass General Brigham secure communication policies."

          "question" : "Can I stop taking part in OurHealth?",
          "answer" : "You can stop participating in OurHealth at any time. However, information that has already been used for research cannot be withdrawn. If you withdraw, any remaining saliva samples and/or data will not be used in future research. To withdraw your permission, reach out to the study team [info@ourhealthstudy.org](mailto:info@ourhealthstudy.org)."
