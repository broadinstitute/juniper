This is bad for patients, and bad for research.</p><p><strong>The solution</strong></p><p>Give everyone the chance to participate in research.</p><p>Rather than relying solely on a handful of hospitals and doctors, we will enable participants to provide their own data.&nbsp;We will use the latest technologies to facilitate research participation from home, rather than relying on travel to distant specialist centres. &nbsp;We will collect genetic material from saliva using kits sent in the post, and gather clinical information from participants using a web portal and smartphone app.</p><p><strong>HeartHive Cardiomyopathy project: </strong></p><p>This is a study of patients with either dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM).&nbsp; Our goal is to further the understanding of DCM and HCM, in particular how genetic and environmental factors interact to cause these conditions and to influence their severity and progression. The study's findings could help develop tailored treatments for patients with cardiomyopathy in the future.</p><p>We are concluding our pilot phase of the project and have secured funding to extend our study for ongoing recruitment. We aim to carry out genetic sequencing for all participants, but our funding is not unlimited, and we may not be able to carry out genetic analysis if more participants enrol in our study than anticipated.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>It's up to you</strong></p><p>We are inviting you to sign up to take part in the HeartHive Cardiomyopathy study.</p><p>Take time to decide whether or not you wish to take part. Please read the following information carefully and discuss it with others if you wish.&nbsp;</p><p>Make sure you clearly understand the study.&nbsp; Before you decide whether to participate in any study it is important for you to understand why the research is being done and what it will involve.</p><p>Thank you for taking the time to read this<em>.</em></p><p><strong>This study is conducted entirely online.</strong></p><p><strong>You can download a copy of the study information sheet at any time.</strong></p>"
