From these data, the OurHealth study team sequences and analyzes the data to discover genomic trends that may explain the high cardiovascular disease risk in South Asians.\n\nSouth Asians have historically been underrepresented in genetic studies, a disparity the OurHealth team hopes to address with your help!",

In particular, higher rates of obesity, insulin resistance, and diabetes appear to drive increased risk for cardiovascular disease. However, the challenge for researchers is that the majority of these studies are neither genetic studies nor clinical trials. Read more about the scientific background here:",

Khera, have extensive experience in studying the genetic basis of cardiovascular and cardiometabolic disease. By closely studying the contribution of genetics towards heart and metabolic disease in individuals of South Asian ancestry living outside the United States, they have helped develop a new genotyping array optimized for South Asians. Unfortunately, South Asian datasets remain limited in size, cultural diversity, and diasporic representation.\n\nHelp us close this gap!
