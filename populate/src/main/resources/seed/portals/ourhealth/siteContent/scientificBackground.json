South Asians are consistently recognized to be at a 2- to 3-fold increased risk for cardiovascular disease and up to 4-fold increased risk of diabetes (especially diabetes that occurs in the absence of obesity). In the United States, South Asian ancestry is now described as a ‘risk-enhancing factor’ for cardiovascular disease in current practice guidelines, highlighting both awareness but glaring knowledge gap."
