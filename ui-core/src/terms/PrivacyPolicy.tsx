      <p>Last Updated: April 28, 2023</p>

      <p>
        The Broad Institute, Inc. (<strong>“Broad,”</strong>{' '}
        <strong>“we,”</strong> <strong>“us,”</strong> or <strong>“our”</strong>)
        values your privacy. This Privacy Policy (<strong>“Policy”</strong>)
        provides important information about how Broad collects and uses your
        Personal Information when you access or use the Juniper Platform (the{' '}
        <strong>“Platform”</strong>). Please review this Policy, which is
        incorporated into and made part of the Terms of Use that apply to you:{' '}
        <Link to="/terms/participant">Participant Terms of Use</Link> or{' '}
        <Link to="/terms/investigator">Investigator Terms of Use</Link>. By
        accessing or using the Platform, you consent to our collection, use, and
        disclosure of your information in accordance with this Policy and our
        Terms of Use. If you do not agree to our Policy or Terms of Use, you may
        not use the Platform.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are a participant in a research project (
        <strong>“Participant User”</strong>) supported by the Platform (each, a{' '}
        <strong>“Research Project”</strong>), the Research Project will collect
        health-related information from you regarding your medical and health
        conditions, treatments, and diagnosis (
        <strong>“Participant User Information”</strong>). Some Participant User
        Information may be gathered from you prior to the Research Project
        commencing to determine if you qualify to participate in the Research
        Project, and other information is collected after you have qualified to
        participate and, where applicable to the Research Project, have signed a
        written consent form to participate. Participant User Information may be
        uploaded to the Platform by you or by persons conducting the Research
        Project.
      </p>
      <p>
        This Privacy Policy also describes how Broad collects, uses, and
        discloses personal information of users who are investigators and or
        other researchers (each, an <strong>“Investigator User”</strong>).
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Important Note to Participant Users</strong>: By participating
        in a Research Project, you may be subject to additional policies,
        including a privacy policy from that Research Project’s sponsor or the
        institution at which the research is conducted. That privacy policy may
        be presented to you in the Platform or through alternate means. You may
        also need to complete an informed consent process before participating
        in research on the Platform. If you are participating in a Research
        Project, you may be asked to provide Participant User Information,
        blood, saliva, and other types of samples to assist in research and
        development activities. The Investigator Users will obtain your
        separate, written consent to use these samples, and our research
        partners’ use of these samples and your Participant User Information
        will be governed by the terms of the consent that you sign and not this
        Policy.
      </p>

      <SectionHeading>Information We Collect</SectionHeading>
      <p>
        We collect information (including Personal Information) about you in two
        ways. The first is information you voluntarily provide to us when you
        choose to do any of the following, none of which is required:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Register to use the Platform, such as when you create an account.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use the Platform to provide us information about you, such as your
          experiences in connection with Research Projects in which you
          participate.
        </li>
        <li>Use the Platform as an Investigator User.</li>
        <li>Respond to surveys we or the researchers may send to you.</li>
        <li>Communicate with us (e.g., by email).</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The second way we collect information is through certain automated
        technologies that are used when you access our Platform. An example is a
        “cookie,” which is a small piece of computer code that is placed on your
        computer or other device that can be used for various purposes, such as
        to recognize a user or to track their activities on a website. We
        describe automated technologies in more detail below. We may collect
        various information through these automated technologies, including your
        Device Information as described below, along with how you use our
        Platform, such as the web pages you view, the links you click, the
        length of time you spend visiting our Platform, and the web page or web
        site that led you to our Platform.
      </p>

      <SectionHeading>What kind of information do we collect?</SectionHeading>
      <p>We collect various types of information:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>“Personal Information”</strong> is information that alone or
          in combination with other information may be used to readily identify,
          contact, or locate you. For example, your name, age, address, phone
          number, email address, clinical data, medical history, and treatment
          type are Personal Information we may collect through your use of the
          Platform once a user has consented to participate in a study.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>“Device Information”</strong> is information that relates to a
          particular computer, mobile device, or other device (e.g., iPad) that
          you use to access the Platform. Device Information includes such
          things as an IP address (which is a number assigned by an internet
          service provider to the computer you use to access the Internet), a
          device ID (which is a number assigned to a mobile phone by the device
          manufacturer), or the type of operating system or web browser used to
          access the Platform.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Other information you choose to provide</strong>, such as when
          you participate in a survey or when you request technical or customer
          support.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <SectionHeading>
        Do we use cookies and other tracking technologies?
      </SectionHeading>
      <p>
        Yes. We use cookies for various purposes, such as to make it easier for
        you to navigate our Platform, to enable a faster log-in process, or to
        allow us to track your activities on our Platform. There are two types
        of cookies: session and persistent cookies.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong className="text-decoration-underline">Session Cookies</strong>
          . Session Cookies exist only during a session. They disappear from
          your computer or device when you close your browser or turn off your
          computer or device. We use Session Cookies to allow our systems to
          uniquely identify you during a session or while you are logged in to
          the Platform. This allows us to process your communications and
          requests and verify your identity after you have logged in and as you
          move through our Platform, and to optimize your experience in using
          the Platform.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong className="text-decoration-underline">
            Persistent Cookies
          </strong>
          . Persistent Cookies remain on your computer or device after you have
          closed your browser or turned off your computer or mobile device. We
          use Persistent Cookies to track aggregate and statistical information
          about user activity on our Platform (see{' '}
          <strong>“Tracking Technologies”</strong> below).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Disabling Cookies</strong>. Most web browsers automatically
        accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can edit your browser options to
        block them in the future. The Help portion of the toolbar on most
        browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new
        cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new
        cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Visitors to our Platform
        who disable cookies may not be able to use the Platform.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Tracking Technologies</strong>. We use analytics tools to
        evaluate our Platform. We use these tools to help us improve our
        Platform, performance, and user experiences. We may also use third-party
        tracking technologies to detect malicious code or attacks on our
        Platform. These entities may use cookies and other tracking technologies
        to perform their services.
      </p>
      <SectionHeading>Do you respond to Do Not Track signals?</SectionHeading>
      <p>
        Do Not Track (<strong>“DNT”</strong>) is a privacy preference that users
        can set in their web browsers. When users turn on DNT, their browser
        sends a message to websites requesting that they do not track the user.
        However, our Platform does not change its information collection in
        response to DNT browser settings or signals. For information about DNT,
        visit <a href="https://www.allaboutdnt.org">www.allaboutdnt.org</a>.
