This module contains auto-generated TypeScript. They are checked into source so that the frontend can be built
and run without Java/gradle dependencies. Do not edit these files directly.

To regenerate these files, run `./gradlew :core:generateGrammarSource -PAntlrOutputLanguage=TypeScript`
from the project root.
